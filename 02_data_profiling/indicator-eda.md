#### 1.1 Interpretation
On average, about 7.3% of women aged 15 and above take loans for farming or business. The typical case is lower, around 5.6%. The amount borrowed varies widely, from nearly zero to over 21%. The data's distribution is a bit flatter than usual, meaning the differences in borrowing amounts aren't as extreme as you might expect. However, there's a lot of missing information, as nearly 98% of the data wasn't reported. The data, covering the years 2014 to 2017, comes from about 62.5% of countries.

#### 1.2 Recommendations
- **Increase Accessibility**: Given the low mean (7.31%) and median (5.56%) of loans borrowed by women, efforts should focus on increasing their accessibility to financial resources.
- **Data Collection Improvement**: With a high percentage of missing values (98.21%), there is a need for more robust and consistent data collection to better understand and address the issue.
- **Targeted Financial Products**: Develop and promote financial products and services specifically tailored to meet the needs of women entrepreneurs.
- **Awareness and Education Programs**: Implement programs to educate women about available financial services and how to access them.

|Kurtois|0.80|Type|Numeric|
#### 1.1 Interpretation
On average, about 9.6% of men aged 15 and above borrow money to start or expand a farm or business, which is higher than the average for women. The typical (median) borrowing rate for men is about 8%. The range of borrowing is quite wide, from as low as 0.72% to as high as 27.82%. The data is somewhat peakier than a normal distribution, suggesting more extreme values in borrowing rates among men. However, like the data for women, around 98% of information is missing. This data, also from 2014 to 2017, is reported by about 62.5% of countries.

#### 1.2 Recommendations
- **Enhance Male Access to Credit**: Despite higher borrowing rates among men, there's still room to improve access to credit for business or farm expansion.
- **Data Improvement**: Address the significant gap in data reporting to better understand and support male entrepreneurs' financial needs.

However, there are still some countries where women face discrimination or restrictions in this regard, as indicated by the minimum value of zero. The data's distribution is highly skewed, meaning that most countries have equal rights for women and men, but a few outliers have very low or no equality. The data covers a long period of time, from 1970 to 2022, and includes almost all countries.

On average, only 12% of countries report that a woman can sign a contract in the same way as a man. The typical case is zero, meaning that most countries do not grant women this right. The data is binary, either 1 or 0, so the standard deviation and kurtosis are not very meaningful. The data has some missing values, about 19%, which may affect the accuracy of the results. The data covers a long period, from 1970 to 2022, and includes almost all countries, about 96%.

|Median|109.50|Countries Reporting|92.86%|
|Maximum|1682.00|From Year (Oldest)|2000|
|Minimum|3.00|To   Year (Latest)|2020|
|Std|260.79|Indicator Code|`SH.STA.MMRT`|
|Kurtois|4.52|Type|Numeric|

#### 23.1 Interpretation
The average maternal mortality ratio is 222.72, meaning that for every 100,000 live births, about 223 women die from pregnancy-related causes. However, the median is much lower, at 109.5, indicating that there are some countries with very high ratios that skew the mean. The maximum ratio is 1682, which is extremely high and alarming. The minimum ratio is 3, which is very low and commendable. The standard deviation is 260.79, which shows that there is a lot of variation in the ratios across countries. The data's distribution is very peaked, meaning that most countries have similar ratios, but there are some outliers with very high or low ratios. The data has a lot of missing values, as 69.05% of the data was not reported. The data covers the years 2000 to 2020 and comes from 92.86% of countries.

#### 23.2 Recommendations
- **Reduce Inequality**: Given the large gap between the maximum and minimum ratios, efforts should focus on reducing the inequality in maternal health outcomes across countries.
- **Data Quality Improvement**: With a high percentage of missing values (69.05%), there is a need for more reliable and timely data collection to monitor and evaluate the progress and challenges in maternal health.

**Description**: The number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in a given year or period, based on national sources or estimates.

| Attribute | Value | Attribute | Value |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: |
|Mean|105.98|Missing Values|83.16%|
|Median|36.00|Countries Reporting|82.14%|
|Maximum|1778.00|From Year (Oldest)|1985|
|Minimum|0.00|To   Year (Latest)|2018|
|Std|209.17|Indicator Code|`SH.STA.MMRT.NE`|
|Kurtois|15.06|Type|Numeric|

#### 24.1 Interpretation
The average maternal mortality ratio across countries is about 106 deaths per 100,000 live births, but the typical case is much lower, at 36 deaths. The ratio varies greatly, from zero to almost 1800 deaths, indicating huge disparities in maternal health outcomes. The data's distribution is very skewed, meaning there are a few extreme cases that drive up the mean. However, the data is also very incomplete, as more than 83% of the values are missing. The data covers the years 1985 to 2018 and comes from about 82% of countries.

#### 24.2 Recommendations
- **Reduce Inequalities**: Given the high maximum (1778) and standard deviation (209) of maternal mortality ratios, efforts should focus on reducing the inequalities in access to quality maternal health care among and within countries.
- **Data Quality Improvement**: With a high percentage of missing values (83%), there is a need for more reliable and timely data collection and reporting to monitor and evaluate the progress and challenges in maternal health.
- **Evidence-Based Interventions**: Implement and scale up evidence-based interventions that address the direct and indirect causes of maternal mortality, such as hemorrhage, infection, hypertensive disorders, unsafe abortion, and HIV/AIDS.



### 25 Life expectancy at birth, female (years)
**Description**: The average number of years a newborn female can expect to live if current mortality rates continue to apply, female (years)

| Attribute | Value | Attribute | Value |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: |
|Mean|64.83|Missing Values|2.15%|
|Median|66.11|Countries Reporting|100.00%|
|Maximum|85.90|From Year (Oldest)|1960|
|Minimum|15.66|To   Year (Latest)|2021|
|Std|11.02|Indicator Code|`SP.DYN.LE00.FE.IN`|
|Kurtois|-0.60|Type|Numeric|

#### 25.1 Interpretation
The mean life expectancy at birth for females is about 65 years, but the median is slightly higher at 66 years. This means that half of the female population lives longer than 66 years, while the other half lives shorter. The maximum life expectancy is almost 86 years, while the minimum is only 16 years. The standard deviation is 11 years, which means that there is a lot of variation in the data. The kurtosis is negative, which means that the data has a flatter distribution than a normal curve, with fewer extreme values. The data covers all countries from 1960 to 2021, with only 2.15% of missing values.

#### 25.2 Recommendations
- **Reduce Inequality**: There is a large gap between the maximum and minimum life expectancy for females, which reflects the inequality in health and living conditions across the world. Efforts should be made to reduce this gap and improve the quality of life for all women.
- **Monitor Trends**: The data shows the historical and current situation of female life expectancy, but it does not predict the future trends. It is important to monitor the changes in life expectancy over time and identify the factors that influence it.
- **Promote Healthy Behaviors**: Life expectancy is affected by many factors, such as genetics, environment, lifestyle, and health care. Some of these factors can be modified by adopting healthy behaviors, such as eating well, exercising regularly, avoiding smoking and alcohol, and getting regular check-ups.



### 26. Life expectancy at birth, male (years)
**Description**: The average number of years a newborn male can expect to live if current mortality rates continue to apply, male (years)

| Attribute | Value | Attribute | Value |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: |
|Mean|60.46|Missing Values|2.15%|
|Median|61.24|Countries Reporting|100.00%|
|Maximum|83.10|From Year (Oldest)|1960|
|Minimum|13.07|To   Year (Latest)|2021|
|Std|10.19|Indicator Code|`SP.DYN.LE00.MA.IN`|
|Kurtois|-0.36|Type|Numeric|

#### 26.1 Interpretation
The global average life expectancy for males is about 60 years, with a typical case slightly higher at 61 years. However, there is a wide gap between the highest and lowest life expectancies, ranging from 83 years in some countries to only 13 years in others. The data's distribution is slightly negative, meaning that there are more countries with lower than average life expectancies than higher ones. The data is fairly complete, with only 2% of missing values. The data covers all countries and spans from 1960 to 2021.

#### 26.2 Recommendations
- **Reduce Inequality**: Address the social and economic factors that contribute to the large disparities in life expectancy across countries and regions.
- **Improve Health Care**: Invest in quality and accessible health care services for males, especially in areas with high mortality rates.
- **Promote Healthy Lifestyles**: Encourage males to adopt healthy behaviors such as avoiding tobacco, alcohol, and violence, and increasing physical activity and nutrition.



### 27. Life expectancy at birth, total (years)
**Description**: The average number of years a newborn is expected to live if current mortality rates continue to apply.

| Attribute | Value | Attribute | Value |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: |
|Mean|62.58|Missing Values|2.15%|
|Median|63.60|Countries Reporting|100.00%|
|Maximum|84.47|From Year (Oldest)|1960|
|Minimum|14.10|To   Year (Latest)|2021|
|Std|10.55|Indicator Code|`SP.DYN.LE00.IN`|
|Kurtois|-0.48|Type|Numeric|

#### 27.1 Interpretation
The global average life expectancy at birth is about 62.6 years, with a median of 63.6 years. This means that half of the world's population can expect to live longer than 63.6 years, and half can expect to live shorter. The maximum life expectancy recorded is 84.5 years, while the minimum is 14.1 years. The standard deviation of 10.6 years indicates that there is a large variation in life expectancy across countries and regions. The data's distribution is slightly negatively skewed, meaning that there are more countries with lower life expectancy than higher. The data covers all countries from 1960 to 2021, with only 2.15% of missing values.

### 27.2 Recommendations
- **Reduce Inequality**: There is a need to address the social and economic factors that contribute to the wide gap in life expectancy between countries and regions, such as poverty, malnutrition, disease, violence, and lack of access to health care and education.
- **Improve Data Quality**: With a relatively low percentage of missing values (2.15%), the data is fairly reliable and comprehensive, but there is still room for improvement in data collection and reporting methods, especially for countries with low life expectancy and high mortality rates.
- **Promote Healthy Lifestyles**: Encourage and support people to adopt healthy behaviors and habits that can increase their life span, such as eating well, exercising regularly, avoiding tobacco and alcohol, and managing stress.
