The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that, when applied, help create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software systems. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin and are widely used in object-oriented programming. The SOLID acronym stands for:
<br><br>
**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**<br>
Definition: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should have only one responsibility.
Importance: Ensures that a class has a clear and focused purpose, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

**Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**<br>
Definition: Software entities (e.g., classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Importance: Promotes the idea that you should be able to add new features or functionality without altering existing code. This leads to more robust and maintainable systems.

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**<br>
Definition: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
Importance: Ensures that objects of a derived class can be used in place of objects of the base class without affecting the functionality of the program. This enables polymorphism and simplifies code reuse.

**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**<br>
Definition: A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
Importance: Encourages the creation of small, specific interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones. Classes should not be burdened with implementing methods they don't need, promoting flexibility and maintainability.

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**<br>
Definition: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
Importance: Inverts the traditional dependency hierarchy, promoting a more flexible and loosely coupled architecture. It encourages the use of abstractions and interfaces, making systems easier to modify and extend.
