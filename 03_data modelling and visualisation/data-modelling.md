# DATA MODELLING

Data Modeling, a widely recogniSed approach in data warehouse design, focuses on building highly functional and easily understandable data warehouses. It emphasises the importance of end-user accessibility and the efficient organisation of data for querying and reporting.

## Data Modelling - Paradigms/Approaches/Methodologies

In the realm of data warehousing, the Inmon and Kimball methodologies represent two distinguished approaches to the design and construction of data warehouses. They primarily differ in their structure and developmental process.

### Inmon Methodology (Top-Down Approach)
- **Developed by**: Bill Inmon
- **Approach**: This is a top-down approach. It commences with the creation of a centralised, normalised, enterprise-wide data warehouse. This warehouse is a substantial repository storing integrated data from various sources.
- **Detail**: It concentrates on creating detailed, normalised data models, often at a very granular level.
- **Process**: Data is initially loaded into this centralised warehouse, and subsequently, if required, it can be summarised or aggregated into smaller, more specialised data marts for specific departmental or functional requirements.
- **Advantages**: 
  - Ensures consistency across the organisation due to a single source of truth.
  - More suitable for complex, large-scale environments where enterprise-wide reporting is essential.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Can be more costly and time-consuming to implement.
  - Initial setup can be intricate and necessitates extensive upfront planning.

### Kimball Methodology (Bottom-Up Approach)
- **Developed by**: Ralph Kimball
- **Approach**: This is a bottom-up approach. It begins with constructing smaller, focused data marts for specific business lines or departments.
- **Detail**: It focuses on building dimensional models, which are typically more straightforward and comprehensible for business users.
- **Process**: Individual data marts are created first, addressing specific business needs. These are then integrated to form a comprehensive data warehouse.
- **Advantages**: 
  - Quicker to implement and realise tangible results.
  - More adaptable and easier for business users to comprehend.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Can lead to data inconsistency if not meticulously managed.
  - Might become intricate over time as more data marts are integrated.

### Why One is Top-Down and the Other Bottom-Up
- **Inmon’s Top-Down**: It's labelled top-down because it starts with an all-encompassing plan for the entire organisation before addressing individual components. It’s akin to building the entire edifice before decorating the rooms.
- **Kimball’s Bottom-Up**: It's termed bottom-up because it initiates with specific, small-scale projects or departmental needs (the "bottom") and gradually builds up to an integrated system. It's comparable to furnishing each room separately and then linking them together into a house.

Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them often hinges on the specific needs and circumstances of the organisation.

### Core Concepts
**Dimensional Modelling**: Organising data into `dimensions/references/embeddings` (descriptive attributes like time, location, product) and `facts/transactions` (measurable performance indicators).
- **Star Schema**: A popular model where a central fact table connects to multiple dimension tables.
- **Snowflake Schema**: A variation where dimension tables are normalised into multiple related tables.
- **Conformed Dimensions**: Ensuring consistency of dimensions across different subject areas.

### Benefits of Data Modelling
- Improved Performance: Efficiently structures data for better query performance.
- Ease of Understanding: Simplifies data structure for end-users, enhancing data comprehension.
- Scalability: Allows for easy addition of new data sources and dimensions.
- User-Friendly Reporting: Facilitates straightforward reporting and analytics.

### Steps in Data Modelling
- Identify Business Processes: Understand key business processes that the data warehouse needs to support.
- Define Grain: Establish the most detailed level at which data is captured for each business process.
- Design Dimensional Model: Develop star or snowflake schemas with appropriate fact and dimension tables.
- ETL Design: Plan the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes to populate the data warehouse.
- Iterative Development: Build and deploy in iterative phases, allowing for adjustments and enhancements.

### Tools and Technologies for Implementation
- Database Platforms: SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, NoSQL (Document, key-value, column, graph, time-series) for storing and managing data.
- ETL Tools: Databricks, Azure Synapse, Azure Data Factory, Informatica, Talend, SSIS for data extraction and transformation.
- Business Intelligence Tools: Tableau, Power BI, Qlik for reporting and data visualisation.

### Best Practices in Data Modelling
- Focus on Business Requirements: Align the data model with specific business needs.
- Keep It Simple: Aim for simplicity in design to facilitate understanding and usage.
- Data Quality Assurance: Implement measures to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
- Collaboration and Documentation: Maintain clear documentation and collaborate with stakeholders for successful implementation.
